<body id="body" type="text">
  <input id="input" type="text" value="Hello">

<!-- 
What will be the output of the code above (lines 4-5)? 
text
undefined 
-->

<!-- Explanation:
Here, type is not a standard attribute of the body tag, whereas, id, type, and value are all standard attributes of the input tag.
Hence, body.type will return undefined. -->

<!-- 
Which of the following are true about DOM properties?
A) DOM properties may not always be strings
Correct

B) DOM property values can never be changed
Incorrect

C) Changing a DOM property always changes its corresponding attribute
Incorrect

D) .value property of the DOM object provides you with the property value
Correct
-->

<!-- 
Option A: 
Correct. 
Majority of the DOM properties such as input.type, input.value, and body.id are of string type; 
however, there are some properties that arenâ€™t, such as the input.checked property. 
input.checked is a boolean value that returns true if the checkbox is checked and false otherwise.

Option B: 
Incorrect. 
DOM properties can be modified; it is the HTML attributes that can never be changed.

Option C: 
Incorrect. 
Changing the value of an attribute always changes its corresponding DOM property's value; 
however, vice versa is not always true. 
For example, changing input.value does not change the value of input.getAttribute('value').

Option D: 
Correct. 
You can access the value of a DOM property using .value with the following syntax: attribute.value.
