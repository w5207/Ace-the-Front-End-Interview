// The singleton pattern is a type of creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object.
// This allows the class to create an instance of the class the first time it is instantiated.
// However, on the next try, the existing instance of the class is returned.
// No new instance is created.

let instance = null;
class Printer {
  constructor(pages) {
    this.display = function () {
      console.log(
        `You are connected to the printer. You want to print ${pages} pages.`
      );
    };
  }

  static getInstance(numOfpages) {
    if (!instance) {
      instance = new Printer(numOfpages);
    }
    return instance;
  }
}

var obj1 = Printer.getInstance(2);
console.log(obj1);
obj1.display();
var obj2 = Printer.getInstance(3);
console.log(obj2);
obj2.display();
console.log(obj2 == obj1);

// The singleton pattern is mostly used in cases where you want a single object to coordinate actions across a system. 
// Singletons are mostly used by:
// 1. Services: 
//    services can be singleton since they store the state, configuration, and provide access to resources. 
//    Therefore, it makes sense to have a single instance of a service in an application.
// 2. Databases: 
//    when it comes to database connections, databases such as MongoDB utilize the singleton pattern.
// 3. Configurations: 
//    if there is an object with a specific configuration, you donâ€™t need a new instance every time that configuration object is needed.
