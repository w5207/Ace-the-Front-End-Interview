# Creational design patterns
These patterns are used to provide a mechanism for creating objects in a specific situation without revealing the creation method. The normal approach for creating an object might lead to complexities in the design of a project. These patterns allow flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a specific use case by providing control over the creation process.
