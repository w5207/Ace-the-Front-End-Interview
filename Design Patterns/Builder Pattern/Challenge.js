// Problem statement:
// In this challenge, you have to complete the implementation of the code after studying the partial code.
// The task here is to implement the builder pattern to create an assignment.
// Each assignment is of a subject: it has a level, which means it is either easy, medium, or hard. It also has a due date.
// The announcement function given to you displays all this information.
// You have to figure out where to put this functionâ€™s definition and how to build the assignment step-by-step.

// Input:
// The provided partial code

// Output:
// Complete implementation of the code and the result after calling the announcement method

// Sample input:
// mathAssignment.announcement();

// Sample output:
// "Your Math assignment is: Hard. It is due on 12th June, 2020."
