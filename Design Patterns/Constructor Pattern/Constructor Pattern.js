// As a JavaScript developer, you may have encountered “constructors” at some point.
// These are special functions that initialize objects with specific properties and methods.
// The “constructor pattern”, as the name defines, is a class-based pattern that uses the constructors present in the class to create specific types of objects.

function Human(name, age, occupation) {
  // ES5 function based constructor
  // defining properties inside the constructor function
  // constructor initializing the property values upon object creation
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.occupation = occupation;
  // defining a method inside the constructor function
  this.describe = function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.age}-year-old ${this.occupation}`);
  };
}
// creating a "person" object using the Human constructor
// the constructor uses the arguments passed into it to
// initialize the property values name, age and sex
var person = new Human("Elle", "23", "Engineer");
// calling the describe method for the person object
person.describe();

// You can use it when you want to create multiple instances of the same template, 
// since the instances can share methods but can still be different. 
// Some examples of where it can be useful include:
// 1. libraries
// 2. plugins
